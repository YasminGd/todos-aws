Link to [project](https://master.d2ufute4qoagol.amplifyapp.com/).

## Getting started

Clone the project or download the files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YasminGd/todos-aws.git
```

Enter the project and make sure you have node_modules installed. After that we will initiate the server with 'npm start':

```bash
npm i 
npm start
```

That's it! The App should open automatically, enjoy!

The project does not include an .env file so the weather storage will not work for you, if you wish to see it in action please go visit the deployed website.
